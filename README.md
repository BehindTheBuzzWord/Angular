# What we will be doing

### Creating an Angular web app

As a first step, we will be creating an angular web app with a .net core backend. Brainstorm an idea of an app. It could be some text displayed on the screen, it could be a list, a table. Anything.

### Make changes & publish

Once this is done, we will be editing the web app and publishing our changes. 

1. Create a component that provides some data to the view
2. Create a service that provides data to the component
3. Create a C# repository that returns the data
